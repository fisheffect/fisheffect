#  Bit
Bit is a Binary Digit. It can only have 2 values, 0 or 1. If we combine bits we can represent larger numbers.
The numbers you see in properties like `UInt160`, `UInt32` are the number of bits that they use.

#  Byte
A byte is a combination of 8 bits. Since the values it can assume is calculated by the number of bits it is composed of. A byte, 8 bits, can have 256 \(2 ^ 8\) values.

#  Byte Array


#  UTF-8
 UTF-8

#  HexString

#  Base58

#  UINT160

A UInt160 is used to represent a 20 byte hash, and might also be referred to as a ScriptHash

#  UINT256

A UInt256 is used to represent a 32 byte hash. This is normally a hash of a Transaction object or a Block
